A simple, fast, user-friendly GUI weather application written in Python using PyQt6.  
It allows users to retrieve real-time weather data for any city using a public API, with clean and readable output.

## Personal Summary

This project helped me gain hands-on experience with API integration, JSON data processing, application development using PyQT and basic CSS styling. 
It also reinforced best practices for structuring a Python application and building a complete, functional tool from start to finish.

## Future Improvements

- Add a 5-day weather forecast option
- Add icons to represent weather
- Add option to view an alternate source for the forecast
